# Problem 8: Two-Sum

This problem was recently asked by Facebook:

You are given a list of numbers, and a target number k. Return whether or not there are two numbers in the list that add up to k.

**Example:**

```bash
Input: arr = [4, 7, 1, -3, 2], k = 5
Ouput: true (since 4 + 1 = 5)
```

```python
def two_sum(lst, k):
    # Fill this in

print(two_sum([4, 7, 1, -3, 2], 5))
# True
