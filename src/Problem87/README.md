# Problem 87: Subarray With Target Sum

This problem was recently asked by Amazon:

You are given an array of integers, and an integer K. Return the subarray which sums to K. You can assume that a solution will always exist.

```python
def find_continuous_k(list, k):
    # Fill this in

print(find_continuous_k([1,2,3,5,7,2], 14))
    # [2, 5, 7]
```

Can you do this in linear time?
