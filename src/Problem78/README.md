# Problem 78: Find the Single Element in an Array of Duplicates

This problem was recently asked by Apple:

Given an array of integers, arr, where all numbers occur twice except one number which occurs once, find the number.
Your solution should ideally be O(n) time and use constant extra space.

**Example:**

```bash
Input: array = [7, 3, 5, 5, 4, 3, 4, 8, 8]
Ouput: 7
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findSingle(self, nums):
        # Fill this in

nums = [1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6]
print(Solution().findSingle(nums))
#3
```
